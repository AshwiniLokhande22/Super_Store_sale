Power BI dashboards can be a helpfull tool to provide insights into sales performance and trends of an organization.
The dashboard should include key metrics such as total sales, sales by Region, sales by Category, sales by Monthly sale, and sales by product category.
It should also provide comparisons of performance to prior years, and allow for drill-down into individual market and products.
